# ZPAQHelper
A GUI for zpaq64.exe

Couldn't find any handy ones. I made this myself. It's the most handy one on the Internet I think. BTW: peazip is good, but mine is lighter and simple, focused on zpaq only.

Main Features:

1. can associate with .zpaq type.

2. compress level and threads is adjustable.

3. can build sfx file.
